# Timesheet

I started this project to practice using html/css/javascript. I would like to improve this as I learn more and use it as part of a project management application for freelance contract projects. I am reading Eloquent Javascript to learn more about managing code complexity.

You can add or remove projects to the list. Each project has a stopwatch, text area for notes and a time table. Click on the project to see the contents. After hitting stop on the stopwatch, a new entry is added to the time table with notes saved from the text area.
