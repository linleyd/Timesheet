# Timesheet

This is a simple timesheet in an html page. You can add or remove projects to the list. Each project has a stopwatch, text area for notes and a time table. Click on the project to see the contents. After hitting stop on the stopwatch, a new entry is added to the time table with notes saved from the text area. 

I made this to learn html, css and javascript.
